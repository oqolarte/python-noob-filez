# python noob filez
repo of all the little python programs that I made with the help of netherweb peepz in order to escape Tutorial Hell. 

feel free to clone the repo for your own use, if it's useful at all.  
`git clone https://github.com/oqolarte/python-noob-filez`  


consider these incomplete, they are noobie exercises after all
